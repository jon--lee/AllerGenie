# AllerGenie
AllerGenie is a web app created by Jonathan Lee, David Lin, Jackelyn Shen, and Harry Xu. The primary purpose of this app is to provide a tool for gauging the danger of eating a restaurant based on a user's allergies and the restaurant's reputation. We use data from Yelp to determine whether a restaurant is safe or dangerous and then present some of the key elements of that data to users so that they can see how AllerGenie came to that conclusion. It should be noted that AllerGenie relies on the structure of Yelp's HTML in order to analyze data. This means that if Yelp's structure changes, AllerGenie may no longer work. However, this app was created only as a temporary example of data collection and processing. Credit goes to David Lin for coming up with the idea and inspiring our work with his personal experience with allergies.
